# WalkieTalkie
Walkie‑Talkie‑de‑Animales – a 1‑page web game that lets 3‑year‑olds say “¡Tigre!” and watch a roaring animation.
A game , web browser friendly. This game is for children 3 years up. Is for them to learn how to pronounce the name of an animal. 
This game is the first one I actually implement. My purpose is to sell a series of apps or games for children that demand short spans of sessions, no more than 10 min I would say or eve less, this is to reduce the amount of time a kid is exposed to blue light. The game is a fun educational game, for kids to have a laugh and learn at the same time.   The concept A walkie talkie with animals. HAs the look and feel of a cool walkie talkie with beautiful big buttons and fun animations and sound with great motion.   The Experience
I want a simple very beautiful game, that attracts both parents and children.Is in Spanish but in the future I want to add Turkish. Is simple entering the game, I want a way to arrive to the page or app and displaying to allow the mic to be used here, and this it, it should not be a problem to press the button and be asked again to allow the mic There is a title saying how to play the game. The microphone has a very low expectation from a child learning to pronounce a name, it has to lower the threshold to activate the animal, we don’t expect perfect pronunciation that is the idea, maybe in another release I can have an evolving sensitivity to the voice. When the name is pronounced the animal gif or png is shown on the display. When the game is idle it prompt you in different funny ways to play again.  UX

Big buttons that feel physical. With a physical feedback specially when using haptics. It feels like a physical walkie talkie. The experience is minimal: typographic compositions, animations, and color. No login, is just play, id doesn’t record any data, it doesn’t remember. Sounds coming out should not be longer than 30 sec.  Errors:
A fun way to display an error when voice is not recognised. With text displaying say again.
Which else - T

From children: 1. Waiting for the food to prepared, I am bored
2. Papa or Mama shows me animals, they are funny, they have names.
3. Food is ready, I am hungry as a tiger!
4. I am in bed now and I look at a book and found my friends the animals, I know their name

Parents
Is a quick and fun way to show them the names and the sounds of different animals

Content - Tigre; Perro; Caballo; Vaca; Gallina - sounds - GIF or .Rive

I don’t want a game that is slow, has to work like a physical playful object.
